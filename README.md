# Julius' Time Machine: Twenty Years Ago - Today.

Greetings, young Ty!

Have you ever wondered what might have been, had you started on your great quest to retrieve the talismans sooner? Say, three months sooner, to be exact.

Well, wonder no more, my Thylacinus cynocephalus friend! Thanks to the enormous power of the excess thunder eggs you've collected, I was able to channel energy into my latest invention - the Temporalis Transportacious Translocator! You may be familiar with the concept - it is a time machine.

With this portal, you will be transported not only through space, but against the flow of time itself! Like swimming against the current of a waterslide, Ty - it's that simple!

When you arrive, do keep in mind that no one will know you've come from the future, not even me - so let's keep that our little secret, shall we?

Sincerely,

Julius
(Inventor Extraordinaire)

**Getting Started**

Julius' Time Machine is a mod designed for the debug build of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger on Steam. It's designed to bring aspects of the 7/1/2002 leaked prototype build to PC, with all benefits thereof. Certain features may work on the latest version, but proper operation is not guaranteed. Follow the following instructions to download the debug build from official servers. (Note: you must have access to a Steam account with a license for the game!)

1. Get DepotDownloader [here](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader/releases/tag/DepotDownloader_2.4.6) and extract it to a directory of your choosing.

2. Open a command prompt window in said directory and run the following commands, with username and password fields replaced with your Steam username and password:

  dotnet DepotDownloader.dll -app 411960 -depot 411962 -manifest 6485427333467227869 -username ■■■■■■ -password ■■■■■■
  
  dotnet DepotDownloader.dll -app 411960 -depot 411961 -manifest 1787916863527675858 -username ■■■■■■ -password ■■■■■■
  
3. You should now have a folder called "depots" which contains two folders - 411961 and 411962. Within each is another folder - the contents of both of which should be copied into a directory of your choice, now referred to as "TY-DEBUG".

4. Extract Julius-Time-Machine.7z from this repository into TY-DEBUG. It should now contain the following:

  PC_External **[folder]**
  
  Data_PC.rkv
  
  Music_PC.rkv
  
  OpenAL32.dll
  
  soft_oal.dll
  
  steam_api.dll
  
  steam_appid.txt
  
  TY.exe
  
  Video_PC.rkv
  
 5. Double click TY.exe and enjoy! You may also want to read up on command line arguments to get more out of your experience - see them [here](https://tcrf.net/Ty_the_Tasmanian_Tiger#Windows_Debug_Commands).

Julius' Time Machine should be fully compatible with normal game saves, but the standard warning applies: the developers of JTM are in no way responsible for any save corruption or other unintended negative side effects. Use this software at your own risk, and back up your data regularly.

It is also suggested that you do not allow Time Attack scores to be submitted to the leaderboards while using this mod, as this could make rankings inaccurate.

Due to a large amount of changes to the game's codebase between prototype and release, some features have not been implemented which were present in the 7/1/02 build. Therefore, this cannot be considered a truly faithful port. However, despite these difficulties, some aspects which were previously inaccessible are now easy to enjoy, including early versions of bonus levels and the E3 demo! With easily accessible debug features, you too can feel like a developer at Krome Studios circa 2002!
