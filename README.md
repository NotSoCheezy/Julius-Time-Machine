# Julius' Time Machine: Twenty Years Ago - Today.

Greetings, young Ty!

Have you ever wondered what might have been, had you started on your great quest to retrieve the talismans sooner? Say, three months sooner, to be exact.

Well, wonder no more, my Thylacinus cynocephalus friend! Thanks to the enormous power of the excess thunder eggs you've collected, I was able to channel energy into my latest invention - the Temporalis Transportacious Translocator! You may be familiar with the concept - it is a time machine.

With this portal, you will be transported not only through space, but against the flow of time itself! Like swimming against the current of a waterslide, Ty - it's that simple!

When you arrive, do keep in mind that no one will know you've come from the future, not even me - so let's keep that our little secret, shall we?

Sincerely,

Julius
(Inventor Extraordinaire)

Getting Started

Julius' Time Machine is a mod designed for the debug build of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger on Steam. Certain features may work on the latest version, but proper operation is not guaranteed. Follow the following instructions to download the debug build from official servers. (Note: you must have access to a Steam account with a license for the game!)

[INSERT INSTRUCTIONS HERE]

Julius' Time Machine should be fully compatible with normal game saves, but the standard warning applies: the developers of JTM are in no way responsible for any save corruption or other unintended negative side effects. Use this software at your own risk, and back up your data regularly.

It is also suggested that you do not allow Time Attack scores to be submitted to the leaderboards while using this mod, as this could make rankings inaccurate.

Due to a large amount of changes to the game's codebase between prototype and release, some features have not been implemented which were present in the 7/1/02 build. Therefore, this cannot be considered a truly faithful port. However, despite these difficulties, some aspects which were previously inaccessible are now easy to enjoy, including early versions of bonus levels and the E3 demo! With easily accessible debug features, you can feel like a developer at 2002 Krome Studios.
