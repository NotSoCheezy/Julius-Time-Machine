TEXT_BOOMERANG_DESC Carved from the wood of an ancient gum tree, this rang is light and fast. Like all boomerangs, it can be thrown in first person by pressing the TY'S VIEW buttonõ. You can also cycle through your rang collection by pressing the NEXT RANG buttonó and PREVIOUS RANG buttonñ.
TEXT_AQUARANG_DESC Found by Rex in an old shipwreck, the Aquarangs can cut through water like a hot knife through butter. Unlike the other rangs, these are the only ones that work under water.
TEXT_FLAMERANG_DESC Harnessing the power of the Fire Thunder Eggs, the Flamerang creates a devastating fireball on impact. Lightweight and durable, not only is it lethal to enemies it can also melt ice.
TEXT_FROSTYRANG_DESC Using the energy from the Ice Thunder Eggs, the Frostyrang can put out fires, freeze enemies and even create ice stepping stones in water!
TEXT_SMASHARANG_DESC .
TEXT_ZAPPYRANG_DESC Brimming with energy from the Lightning Thunder Eggs, the Zappyrang is a highly charged rang with enough power to jump-start a generator.
TEXT_ZOOMERANG_DESC With a built in telescopic aimer, the Zoomerang has the longest reach of all the rangs. You can use it to zoom in on far away objects.
TEXT_MULTIRANG_DESC Not as fast or far reaching as the others, the Multirang lets you throw multiple rangs at the same time. Use it to unleash a frenzy of boomerang justice on Cass' henchmen!
TEXT_INFRARANG_DESC Using a special infrared attachment, the Infrarang will enable you to see things you couldn't see before when you press the TY'S VIEW buttonõ. Make sure you scan for secrets when you visit somewhere new!
TEXT_MEGARANG_DESC Using Julius' patented Super Seeking Technology, the Megarang has the ability to auto target both enemies and crates. Useful when you run into a bunch of Cass' henchmen.
TEXT_KABOOMARANG_DESC Made from Exploderium, an ancient substance found only in the Outback, the Kaboomarang creates a deadly explosion on impact.
TEXT_CHRONORANG_DESC Using Julius' latest invention, the Trans Temporal Transistor, the Chronorang can affect the time field around Cass' henchmen causing them to slow down.
TEXT_DOOMARANG_DESC The Doomerang can be controlled remotely allowing you to fly it into out of the way places. Passed down through TY's family this is a last minute gift from Sly.
TEXT_LASSORANG_DESC Created by Julius, the Lassorangs can be used to hook enemies and wayward emus. If you hook something you can reel it in by pressing the THROW buttoní. These are only available when riding Bull.

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0001 Ok TY, I'm it. Catch me if you can!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0002 Woooohhhh! Uggh.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0003 Don't move mate. I'll get help.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0004 Don't be afraid TY.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0005 I am Nandu Gili, the bunyip elder...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0006 G'day mate.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0007 It's time you knew the truth.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0008 Years ago, a great battle was fought over the fate of five mystic talismans.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0009 My dinosaur ancestors were here first, you stinking furry mammal opportunists.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0010 Remember the comet!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0011 Nooooo! You mammals don't deserve to be at the top of the food chain!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0012 Now!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0013 Grrr.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0014 Now to restore the natural order, once and for all!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0015 Yaaargh!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0016 Oooooh, my head.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0017 Never! Never! Never!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0018 Hahahahahaaa!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0019 Bye Bye...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0020 Nooooooooo!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0021 Those brave few who challenged Boss Cass were trapped in the Dreaming.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0022 Mum? Dad?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0023 Word grows that Boss Cass is seeking out the talismans again.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0024 He must be stopped at all costs.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0025 It's up to you to find the talismans before he does.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0026 It's up to me to save my family!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0027 Oi! TY! Are you ok?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0028 Maurie? Ah, am I glad to see you!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0029 You're never going to believe what just happened!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0030 I was playing in the forest, when the ground suddenly...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0031 ... and that's when you showed up.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0032 Struth! Sounds like you've got a fair dinkum adventure ahead of you mate.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0033 Not that I'm inta that sorta thing.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0034 I'd much rather be at home, watchin the footy...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0035 But! I tell ya what. You do the adventurin, and I'll help you out where I can...

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0036 Well done TY.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0037 You've retrieved the first of the ancient talismans.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0038 When Boss Cass discovers that we're out to thwart his plans
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0039 he will do all in his power to stop you.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0040 Be careful, my friend.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0041 She'll be right old timer!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0042 Strike me lucky! You actually found the talisman.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0043 I just might've bet on the wrong horse.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0044 Anyway mate, Julius has got a present for you at his lab.

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0045 I see you have retrieved the third talisman.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0046 Do not become complacent in your quest.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0047 There is still much danger ahead.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0048 Well, I have to admit it, you're not doing such a bad job mate.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0049 Well, adequate ma-maybe, but but but, not bad.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0050 Now. Julius is waiting for you, back at his lab.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0051 I think he's got a new gadget for ya!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0052 Bonza!

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0053 You have come far. This will be no easy task.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0054 But I have faith in you my friend.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0055 Don't just stand there like a stunned mullet mate!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0056 Julius has got something that will help you enter Cass' Crest mate.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0057 Off you go.

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0058 I found it. I found it!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0059 Let me see that.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0060 At last... A mystic talisman.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0061 It's time to move out.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0062 We got four more talismans to find.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0063 You there! Fetch my bags.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0064 Heh heh heh...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0065 Soon unimaginable power will be mine mine miiine.

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0066 You have done well my friend.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0067 The information you supplied is invaluable.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0068 So someone thinks they can stop me obtaining all the talismans.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0069 Of course he will no succeed!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0070 I want this meddling mammal stopped at any cost.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0071 Yes sir. Right away sir.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0072 Both talismans are as good as mine.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0073 Begin phase 2!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0074 Hahahaha.
 
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0075 You go first.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0076 No, you go first.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0077 Nyah, I went first last time.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0078 Get in here!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0079 Did you take care of that troublesome tasmanian tiger?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0080 That's just the thing, see...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0081 He's kind of, umm, well, err... good!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0082 Whaaat?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0083 I cannot believe that a rat could outwit my two best lizards.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0084 He's too tough for us Boss.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0085 Ehh, you know, uhh... I was, ehh, thinking...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0086 Eeh, instead of trying to stop him, maybe we should, uhhh...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0087 You ok Boss?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0088 Come over here.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0089 Juuust come over here.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0090 I won't hurt you.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0091 Now. What's my name?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0092 Uhh... Cass?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0093 No. That's my last name.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0094 What's my first name?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0095 Ooh! Ooh! I know! I know!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0096 Let him answer!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0097 Uhh... Boss?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0098 That's right.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0099 And. I'm. The. Only. Boss. Around. Here.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0100 And. I. Do. All. The. Thinkin. Now, get outa my sight!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0101 Imbeciles. I've surrounded myself with numbskull imbeciles.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0102 Maybe I can help.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0103 After all, who knows tasmanian tigers better than... meee.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0104 Who indeed.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0105 Hah. Hah. Ha. Hah. Hah. Ha. Hah. Hah. Haaa...

TEXT_VIDEO_ST0106 Did you take care of our little problem?
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0107 I tried, but umm...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0108 He's stronger than I thought.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0109 He's stronger than you thought.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0110 How. Hard. Can. It. Be?!
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0111 It's. Just. A. Little orange...
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0112 rat.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0113 He has friends. The bunyips are helping him.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0114 What?! Aha, then the stakes have been raised.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0115 To take over the world, I must have those talismans.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0116 I need them to open the portal to the dreamtime,
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0117 so I can banish all those annoying warm-blooded mammals
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0118 once and for all.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0119 Present company excepted, of course.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0120 Well, if our orange friend is so intent on finding
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0121 the talismans, then I say, let him.
TEXT_VIDEO_ST0122 My metal menace here will take care of him
