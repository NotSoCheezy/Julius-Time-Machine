To create a new icon here, follow these steps.

Step 1: Delete old icon files (icon.tga and icon.tpl)
	NOTE: DO NOT DELETE "icon.tcs"

Step 2: Copy "icon.tga" to this directory

Step 3: Run "make_icon.bat"

Step 4: Make sure "icon.tpl" exists in the folder (if it doesn't then icon was not created)

DONE...
